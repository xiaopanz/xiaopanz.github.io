I am a first-year PhD student at the University of California, Riverside, specializing in Robotics. Prior to embarking on my doctoral journey, I earned my Master of Science degree in Computer Science from the University of Southern California in 2023, following a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor in 2021. My academic and professional trajectory is fueled by a passion for robotics research, which serves as the cornerstone of my pursuits. Beyond academia, I devote my free time to actively contributing to open-source projects, further nurturing my commitment to advancing the field.
