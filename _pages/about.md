HelloðŸ‘‹! I am Xiaopan Zhang(å¼ æ™“æ”€), a first-year PhD student at <a href="https://www.ucr.edu">University of California - Riverside</a>, advised by Professor <a href="https://jiachenli94.github.io">Jiachen Li</a>. My research interests lie in robotics, with a particular emphasis on crafting trustworthy algorithms for the generalization of multi-robot coordination, as well as enhancing robot-human collaboration in practical, real-world scenarios.

Prior to starting on my doctoral journey, I earned my Master of Science degree in Computer Science from the University of Southern California in 2023, following a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor in 2021. My academic and professional trajectory is fueled by a passion for robotics research, which serves as the cornerstone of my pursuits. Beyond academia, I devote my free time to actively contributing to open-source projects.
